    <h3>What is our purpose?</h3>
    <p>The Schuler Scholar Program equips bright, motivated youth with the support they need to gain access to and succeed at highly selective colleges and beyond. Schuler Scholars are typically first generation college-bound, are students of color, or come from low-income families.</p>
    <p>We are based in Lake Forest, Illinois with 14 partnership high schools in Chicago and the northern suburbs. Our program works with Scholars for four years in high school and continues to provide professional development and supportive services to Scholars during college and beyond.</p>
